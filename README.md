# spotify-api-integration
This repository is showing an integration of the Spotify API using Javascript to make the calls requesting for authentication to take action on behalf of users. We used this integration as part of a release strategy to get users to follow our artists and add their top songs to their personal libraries. 


## API Calls Used

To authorize the calls on behalf of the users, I used the Implicit grant flow since I did everything using purely JavaScript. 

1. Follow API

I used the follow API to check if the user followed the teams (RichMusic) artists and playlists. Then, I initiated a call to have them follow our playlist and artists.

2. Library API

I used the library API to check if the user had our tracks saved to their playlist and if not, I saved it for them so they can listen to later on!


## Goal

I created this landing page as a follow campaign in anticipation to a holiday EP we were releasing. The goal was to get users to follow our artists, follow our playlists, and save our artists top tracks so that they can continue enjoying our artists music and stay up to date with their most recent releases.
